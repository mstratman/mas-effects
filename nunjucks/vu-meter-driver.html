          <p>Most VU meters these days are actually DC meters, so they need a rectifier. And if you're going to use them you typically want a buffer to prevent noise, too.</p>
          <p>The good news is you can get the meters dirt cheap, and scavenge them from battery testers, CB testers, and other old junk.</p>
          <p>This PCB is a dead quiet, simple drop-in for any pedal, and should work with any DC meter. It provides a decorative dancing needle to your audio projects, but understand this isn't an ideal way to take measurements if accuracy is your goal.</p>
