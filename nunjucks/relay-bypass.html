          <p>Typical 3PDT latching mechanical switches are noisy, hard to press, and prone to mechanical failure after repeated use. A controller board with a relay is a great alternative, and provides some other really great options you couldn't otherwise do.</p>
          <p>This tiny and featureful relay bypass board can do a LOT.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Soft touch</strong>, momentary switches can toggle your DIY guitar pedal, using a relay to provide <strong>true bypass</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Remembers</strong> whether your effect is bypassed or engaged, and next time you power up the pedal it will recall this setting. You can change to auto-on or auto-off by holding the switch while powering on.</li>
            <li><strong>Quick tap to switch</strong> between engaged and bypass, or <strong>hold the footswitch to temporarily toggle</strong> until you release it</li>
            <li>Fits easily in a tiny <strong>1590A</strong> enclosure</li>
            <li>Optional <strong>optocoupler muting</strong> can be enabled with a switch or jumper to mute any popping your circuit might exhibit while switching</li>
            <li>VERY cost effective.
